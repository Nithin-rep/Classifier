# Classifier

* In this project, Iam using CIFAR10 data to perform image classifications using DeepLearning
(CIFAR10 - is a dataset with 10 image classes)

* "Classifier project practice file.py " - is the main project file

* "dataset_classi.py " - used to generate, preprocessing and loading data into dataloaders
* "trainer.py " - used for creating training, validation and test steps the data has to undergo

* "net_calssi.py " - Neural network used for the classification task

* "dataset_acc.py " - python file for accuaracy measurment and evaluation matrics like precision, recall and F1 score
* 'storing_the_data.py " - to store the results
